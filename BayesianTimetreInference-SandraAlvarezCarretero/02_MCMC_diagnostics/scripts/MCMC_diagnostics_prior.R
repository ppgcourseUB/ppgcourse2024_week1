# DEFINE GLOBAL VARIABLES -- modify according to your dataset #
#-------------------------------------------------------------#
# First, we will define the global variables that match the settings in our 
# analysis.

# 1. Number of chains
num_chains <- 6

# 2. Number of divergence times that have been estimated. One trick to find
# this out quickly is to subtract 1 to the number of species. In this case,
# there are 8 taxa (8), so the number of internal nodes
# is `n_taxa-=8-1=7`.
# Another way to verify this is by opening the `mcmc.txt` file and check the
# header. The first element after `Gen` will have the format of `t_nX`, where
# X will be an integer (i.e., 9). Subtract two to this number 
# (i.e., 9-2=7) and this will be your number of divergence times that are 
# parameters of the MCMC. Please modify the number below so it fits to the 
# dataset you are using. 
num_divt <- 7

# 3. Number of samples that you specified in the `MCMCtree` control file to 
# collect. NOTE: you may have not collect them all, but do not worry!
def_samples <- 20000

# 4. Quantile percentage that you want to set By default, the variable below is 
# set to 0.975 so the 97.5% and 2.5% quantiles (i.e., 95%CI). If you want to
# change this, however, just modify the value.
perc <- 0.975

# 5. Load a semicolon-separated file with info about calibrated nodes. Note that
# this file is output by script `Merge_node_labels.R`. A summary of its content
# in case you are to generate your own input files:
#
# Each column needs to be separated with semicolons and an extra blank line
# after the last row with calibration information needs to be added. If the
# extra blank is not added, R will complain and will not load the file!
# If you add a header, please make sure you name the column elements as 
# `Calib;node;Prior`. If not, the R function below will deal with the header,
# but make sure you set `head_avail = FALSE` when running `read_calib_f` 
# function below. An example of the content of this file is given below:
#
# ```
# Calib;node;Prior
# ex_n5;5;ST(5.8300,0.0590,0.1120,109.1240)
# ex_n7;7;B(4.1200,4.5200,0.0250,0.0250)
#
# ```
#
# The first column will have the name of the calibration/s that can help you
# identify which node belongs to which calibration. The second column is the
# number given to this node by`MCMCtree` (this information is automatically
# found when you run the script `Merge_node_labels.R`, otherwise you will need
# to keep checking the output file `node_trees.tree` to figure out which node
# is which). The third column is the calibration used for that node in
# `MCMCtree` format.
# 
# [[ NOTES ABOUT ALLOWED CALIBRATION FORMATS]]
#
# Soft-bound calibrations: 
#  E.g.1: A calibration with a minimum of 0.6 and a maximum of 0.8 would with  
#         the default tail probabilities would have the following equivalent 
#         formats:
#         >> B(0.6,0.8) | B(0.6,0.8,0.025,0.025)
#  E.g.2: A calibration with a minimum of 0.6 and a maximum of 0.8 would with  
#         the pL=0.001 and pU=0.025 would have the following format. Note that, 
#         whenever you want to modify either pL or pU, you need to write down 
#         the four  parameters in the format of "B(min,max,pL,pU)":
#         >> B(0.6,0.8,0.001,0.025)
#
# Lower-bound calibrations: 
#  E.g.1: A calibration with a minimum of 0.6 and the default parameters for
#         p = 0.1, c = 1, pL = 0.025:
#         >> L(0.6) | L(0.6,0.1,1,0.025)
#  E.g.2: A calibration with a hard minimum at 0.6, and so pL = 1e-300. 
#         Note that, whenever you want to modify either pL or pU, you need to  
#         write down the four parameters in the format of "L(min,p,c,pL)":
#         >> L(0.6,0.1,1,1e-300)
#
# Upper-bound calibrations: 
#  E.g.1: A calibration with a maximum of 0.8 and the default parameters for
#         pU = 0.025:
#         >> U(0.8) | U(0.8,0.025)
#  E.g.2: A calibration with a hard maximum at 0.8, and so pU = 1e-300. 
#         Note that, if you want to modify pU, you need to write down the two
#         parameters in the format of "U(max,pU)":
#         >> U(0.8,1e-300)
#
# ST distributions: 
#  The format accepted has four parameters: xi (location, mean root age), 
#  omega (scale), alpha (shape), nu (df). Accepted format: 
#  >> ST(5.8300,0.0590,0.1120,109.1240)
#
# SN distributions: 
#  The format accepted has three parameters: xi (location, mean root age), 
#  omega (scale), alpha (shape). Accepted format: 
#  >> SN(5.8300,0.0590,0.1120)

# 6. Number of columns in the `mcmc.txt` that are to be deleted as they do not 
# correspond to sample values for divergence times (i.e., the entries are not 
# names following the format `t_nX`). To figure out this number quickly, you 
# can open the `mcmc.txt` file, read the header, and count the number of `mu*`
# elements. Do not count the `lnL` value when looking at 
# `mcmc.txt` files generated when sampling from the posterior -- this is 
# automatically accounted for in the in-house R functions that you will 
# subsequently use. E.g., you expect to see as many `mu[0-9]` as alignment
# blocks you have in your sequence file! E.g., if you had two alignment blocks,
# you would speciy `delcol_prior <- 2`. Please modify the value/s below 
# (depending on having one or more datasets) according to the `mcmc.txt` file
# generated when sampling from the prior (`delcol_prior`)
##> NOTE: If you ran `MCMCtree` with `clock = 2` or `clock = 3` when
##> sampling from the prior, you will also need to count the `sigma2*`
##> columns! We ran `clock = 1` so that the analyses ran quicker, and thus
##> we only have `mu*` columns.
